# Description

With the rise of Internet, customers are increasingly willing to express their opinions. We can find that customers are highly likely to check reviews before purchases and also prefer to share their reviews and user experience, especially for online shopping. So through analysis of customer reviews, the company can better understand customers’ opinions and needs, and can make more informed business decisions. In this project, we’ll use machine learning to analyze an e-commerce company’s customer reviews data and find out the insights and internal relations of the reviews. Further, we can use these information to help us solve some business use cases, like improve conversion rate.
