# Description

In this project, you will build a unified ML/AI data pipeline based on Google Cloud platform. You will build a complete ML pipeline, covering data analysis, data preparation and feature engineering, model training and deployment in the cloud. You will also learn how to tune deep and wide model based on TensorFlow for better algorithms performance, and manage the data pipeline with Kubeflow Argo and serve the model with Kubeflow Seldon.

# Thoughts

1. If you need to get familar with it, you need to practise it a lot. Especially you need to know how to handle the machine failure mechanism. Chaos Engineering may be a good choice.
